# Surfs Up Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide temperature statistics from the months of June and December in order to help invenstors decide if running a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu is sustainable year-round. The data is stored in a SQLite database and queried in order to be converted to a list and then into a dataframe in order to run summary statistics on temperature for the two months.
